# Chatbot for Schools and Education

This project is a custom-built chatbot designed to help schools and educational institutions provide interactive, AI-powered assistance to students and staff. It leverages the power of OpenAI's language models to facilitate natural, intuitive conversations, helping with tasks such as answering student queries, providing learning resources, assisting with administrative duties, and enhancing overall engagement in the educational environment. The chatbot can be customized to fit the specific needs of different educational settings, making it a versatile tool for improving communication and learning experiences.

To get started, users need to provide their own OpenAI API key to authenticate and access the chatbot's capabilities. This ensures that each user has control over their usage and API limits. Simply follow the setup instructions to integrate your API key, and youâ€™ll be ready to deploy the chatbot in your school or educational environment. The bot can be easily adapted for different use cases, from tutoring to virtual assistance, making it a valuable addition to any institution looking to integrate AI into their educational tools.

## Setting up your API Key

You can set your OpenAI API key **ONCE** by appending it as a URL parameter when accessing the chatbot:

```
https://your-chatbot-url.com/?set-api-key=your-openai-api-key
```

This method allows for quick setup without needing to modify any configuration files. The API key will be securely stored in your browser's session for subsequent interactions with the chatbot.

## Using with Veyon Master

Use [Veyon Master](https://veyon.io/en/) to deploy the URL simultaneously across all client computers to set the API key. Alternatively, you can configure each client computer individually.
